# hello-world

Hello! My name is Doug Barnes and I am a 24-year-old software developer. I am still in the learning stages and hope to progress quickly in this vocation of mine. As of right now I am learning PHP and SQL along with the framework Laravel! I make sure to practice every day, so I can become a pro!!!
